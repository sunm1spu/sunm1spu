### Featured Projects:
## ETC Backend
https://github.com/tranleduyan/ETC-Backend
- ETC is the senior capstone project that I and a team of four other students from SPU ECS developed over the course of nine months.
- My primary roles were to help design how the entire system would work end-to-end from hardware to our backend, and how users could use our product. My contributions to this repository were the parts of the API that were to communicate with antennas or would deal with scans in any way.
- Some of my contribution that I'm most proud of were the ways in which check ins and check outs were defined and handled, and how the reservation and checkout system logically work as an overall system.

## ETC RFID Antenna Client
https://github.com/sunm1spu/Dullahan
- This repository is another component of the ETC system. It is the application that is the be run on a microprocessor connected to a UHF RFID antenna to serve as its reader so it can send and recieve requests from the backend.
- I am solely responsible for this aspect of the project, which is basically a console application that utilizes the provided RFID antenna libraries provided by CNCEST.
- Some particularly interesting aspects of this application were the issue of debouncing recent consecutive RFID tag scans and also assigning item scans to a user.
